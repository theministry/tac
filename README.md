# How ToGether

This shared future landscape research is part of the future Temporary Art Centre(TAC) development series. Looking at the social structures of work and leisure, we want to reimagine the commons and examine our communal behaviours and actions within the framework of spatial identity â€” DOING is an action and DOING TOGETHER through various instructions written by the inhabitants is an attitude and learning / unlearning process to shape our common terrains together.
