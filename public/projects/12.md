We all get on our bycicles and ride to the lake. By then, you are sweating and the water is appetizing and refreshing. Shy people are wearing their swimming suit underneath their clothes. People without inhibitions change at the spot. It is not advice to swim with your clothes on. Somebody blows a whistle and, in unison, everybody jumps into the water. Swimming is a solitary activity, unless you do swimming laps in a friendly competition, where a team, compromised of a number of individuals divided by the amount of people who went swimming forming at least 2 teams, swim each one lap. Some form of buoyant object can be placed in advance to limit the race. Once done, everybody gets out, and runs a lap around the race so as to dry. Singing is encouraged.
