1-First you get in your car, and you check all the mirrors, and see if you have gas. 

2-Then you pick up other TAC members in your area, as to be more ecological. 

3- Then you drive to TAC, avoiding road rage at all costs. 

4- Upon arrival, whoever you picked up gets out of the car and opens the gate. 

5- Slowly, minding all sharp angles around you, you follow their indications. TAC will provide a gigantic neon hand for those shortsighted. 

6- Hopefully they would have lead up without incident to your spot. 7-You get out of the car, and close it.
