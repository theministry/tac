On the roof there is a herb garden because of which the room downstairs smells like mint. Everyday people gather on the roof and tend the garden. Summers are warm and the rooftop is in bloom while people sit around the round-shaped table to drink their tea. It is grown by TAC, the tea and people alike. We grow and drink tea as an organism. Each season we make more. We have workshops to gather understanding of tea-growing. We share the herb pots as TAC pets. They are cared for and provided for. They have names. Every winter people sit at the round-shaped table to drink the tea they named. The act is breathing in the pace of seasons.
