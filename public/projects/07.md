Shape your sheep and ship it on. One should shape hers/his sheep, as poodles are shaped across the globe. Each specifically shaped sheep travels to meet its new sheep shaper. We shape and feed our sheep together. We shape the sheep and feed the sheep in a uniform manner. Each day the sheep is shipped to the next sheep feeder. We feed and ship our sheep together.
