During Dutch Design Week 2020, Timothy showed a series of installations about TAC assets. TAC’s assets expand into the city and beyond. The installation *INSIDE OUT* uses replacement, extension and retraction to explore the relation between and *individual and institution*, and between *urban and shared assets.* The boundaries between public and private are blurred: the once clear lines between inside and outside, known and unknown, and between ourselves and the others are shifting. Through the ever-changing concept of common space, Timothy Liu is questioning today's social needs and sensibilities to imagine the future of this fluid organism.

**Community Garden Tuinn**

Tuinn is an extensive public green space, where residents can bring their own plants from their homes to this neighborhood communal garden when needed (e.g., holidays, business trips, etc) and invite the local community to take care and appreciate the plants together. We’re proposing a rethink of the community resilience in private and public domains by using plants as a medium and shared asset to consider what a more inclusive and caring society would be?
