During Dutch Design Week 2020, Timothy showed a series of installations about TAC assets. TACâ€™s assets expand into the city and beyond. The installation _INSIDE OUT_ uses replacement, extension and retraction to explore the relation between and _individual and institution_, and between _urban and shared assets._ The boundaries between public and private are blurred: the once clear lines between inside and outside, known and unknown, and between ourselves and the others are shifting. Through the ever-changing concept of common space, Timothy Liu is questioning today's social needs and sensibilities to imagine the future of this fluid organism.
