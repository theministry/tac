# INTERVIEW

_Door2Door interviews_ are face to face interviews with TAC residents in the intimate environment of their own studio. This format enables meaningful engagement while we talk about the function of space and infrastructures. TAC residents, as civic assets of TAC, have an important role within co-creation of common space and codes of identity.
